# Telescopes
Telescope tile codes for use in Spelunky 2 level mods

## Usage

The only thing required to use the telescopes is to load in the script and use one of the two tile codes:
- `telescope`, for a telescope facing towards the right.
- `telescope_left`, for a telescope facing towards the left.

Both tile codes act the same; the only difference is how the telescope looks.
